Although several risk factors for recurrence have been reported in patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) early breast cancer in Japan, there has been no systematic review quantifying potential risk factors. We performed a systematic literature review and meta-analysis using the MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Japan Medical Abstract Society databases to identify risk factors for recurrence in HR+/HER2- early breast cancer in Japan. The primary outcome was relapse-free or disease-free survival (RFS/DFS), and the secondary outcomes were overall survival and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS). Searches identified 42 eligible publications. Meta-analyses identified lymph node metastasis (hazard ratio: 2.76 [95% confidence interval: 1.97-3.88]), large tumor size (1.67 [1.24-2.23]), high histological grade (1.50 [1.04-2.16]), and high nuclear grade (2.02 [1.61-2.54]) as risk factors for RFS/DFS. Lymph node metastasis (2.43 [1.28-4.63]), large tumor size (1.80 [1.24-2.62]), and high histological grade (2.02 [1.44-2.84]) were also risk factors for overall survival, and high progesterone status was a possible favorable prognostic factor for BCSS (0.20 [0.10-0.42]). Identified risk factors were consistent with the previous reports, and this study provides quantitative summary of risk factors for HR+/HER2- early breast cancer recurrence in Japan.

The aim of this registry study was to provide insight into the oncological safety of omitting completion axillary treatment in patients operated with mastectomy who have limited-volume sentinel lymph node metastasis. Women diagnosed in 2013-2014 with unilateral cT1-2 N0 breast cancer treated with mastectomy, with one to three sentinel lymph node metastases (pN1mi-pN1a), were identified from the Netherlands Cancer Registry, and classified by axillary treatment: no completion axillary treatment, completion axillary lymph node dissection, regional radiotherapy, or completion axillary lymph node dissection followed by regional radiotherapy. The primary endpoint was 5-year regional recurrence rate. Secondary endpoints included recurrence-free interval and overall survival, among others. In total, 1090 patients were included (no completion axillary treatment, 219 (20.1%); completion axillary lymph node dissection, 437 (40.1%); regional radiotherapy, 327 (30.0%); completion axillary lymph node dissection and regional radiotherapy, 107 (9.8%)). Patients in the group without completion axillary treatment had more favourable tumour characteristics and were older. The overall 5-year regional recurrence rate was 1.3%, and did not differ significantly between the groups. The recurrence-free interval was also comparable among groups. The group of patients who did not undergo completion axillary treatment had statistically significantly worse 5-year overall survival, owing to a higher percentage of non-cancer deaths. In this registry study of patients with cT1-2 N0 breast cancer treated with mastectomy, with low-volume sentinel lymph node metastasis, the 5-year regional recurrence rate was low and comparable between patients with and without completion axillary treatment.'",b'No',No
b'38597133',b'What is the relationship between the local population change and cancer incidence in patients with dyslipidemia: Evidence of the impact of local extinction in Korea.',b'Cancer medicine',"b'Wonjeong Jeong, Dong-Woo Choi, Woorim Kim, Kyu-Tae Han'",b'2024-Apr-01',b'',b'10.1002/cam4.7169',"b""Changes in the local population are intricately linked to healthcare infrastructure, which subsequently impacts the healthcare sector. A decreasing local population can result in lagging health infrastructure, potentially leading to adverse health outcomes as patients may be at risk of not receiving optimal care and treatment. While some studies have explored the relationship between chronic diseases and local population decline, evidence regarding cancer is insufficient. In this study, we focused on how deteriorating management of chronic diseases such as dyslipidemia could influence the risk of cancer. We investigated the relationship between changes in the local population and cancer incidence among patients with dyslipidemia. This cohort study was conducted using claims data. Data from adult patients with dyslipidemia from the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort conducted between 2002 and 2015 were included. Population changes in each region were obtained from the Korean Statistical Information Service and were used to link each individual's regional code. Cancer risk was the dependent variable, and Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the target associations. Data from 336,883 patients with dyslipidemia were analyzed. Individuals who resided in areas with a decreasing population had a higher risk of cancer than those living in areas with an increasing population (decrease: hazard ratio (HR)\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891.06, 95% CI\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891.03-1.10; normal: HR\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891.05, 95% CI\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891.02-1.09). Participants living in regions with a low number of hospitals had a higher risk of cancer than those in regions with a higher number of hospitals (HR\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891.20, 95% CI\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891.12-1.29). Patients in regions where the population has declined are at a higher risk of cancer, highlighting the importance of managing medical problems caused by regional extinction. This could provide evidence for and useful insights into official policies on population decline and cancer risk.""",b'No',No

However, the effect of chidamide plus envafolimab has not been reported. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of chidamide plus envafolimab in advanced NSCLC patients resistant toanti-PD-1 treatment. Eligible advanced NSCLC patients after resistant to anti-PD-1 therapy received chidamide and envafolimab. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). The secondary end points included disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), and safety. The expression of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), PD-L1, and blood TMB (bTMB) was also analyzed. After a median follow-up of 8.1 (range: 7.6-9.2) months, only two patients achieved partial response. The ORR was 6.7% (2/30), DCR was 50% (15/30), and median PFS (mPFS) was 3.5 (95% confidence interval: 1.9-5.5) months. Biomarker analysis revealed that patients with high-level HDAC2 expression had numerically superior ORR (4.3% vs. 0), DCR (52.2% vs. 0) and mPFS (3.7 vs. 1.4m). Patients with negative PD-L1 had numerically superior DCR (52.2% vs. 33.3%) and mPFS (3.7m vs. 1.8m), so were those with low-level bTMB (DCR: 59.1% vs. 16.7%, mPFS: 3.8 vs.1.9m). Overall safety was controllable. High HDAC2patients showed better ORR, DCR, and PFS. In addition, patient with negative PD-L1 and low-level bTMB had better DCR and PFS. This may be related to the epigenetic function of chidamide. However, the sample size was not big enough, so it is necessary to increase sample size to confirm the conclusion. Combination of chidamide and envafolimab showed efficacy signals in certain NSCLC patients. But further identification of beneficial population is necessary for precision treatment.'",b'No',No

Patients with incident (January 2016 to March 2021) DLBCL age \xe2\x89\xa518\xe2\x80\x89years who initiated first-line (1L) therapy were identified from the COTA real-world database. Baseline characteristics, treatment patterns, and real-world outcomes, including time to next treatment (rwTTNT) and overall survival (rwOS), were assessed for the study population and by line of therapy (LOT). A total of 1347 eligible DLBCL patients were identified. Of these, 340 (25.2%) proceeded to receive 2L, of whom 141 (41.5%) proceeded to receive 3L, of whom 51 (36.2%) proceeded to receive 4L+. Most common treatments were R-CHOP in 1L (63.6%), stem cell transplant (SCT) in 2L (17.9%), polatuzumab vedotin, bendamustine, and rituximab (Pola-BR) in 3L (9.9%), and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T) in 4L (11.8%). Treatment patterns were more variable in later LOTs. One- and 3-year rwOS from 1L initiation were 88.5% and 78.4%, respectively. Patients who received later LOTs experienced numerically lower 1- and 3-year rwOS (from 2L initiation: 62.4% and 46.4%, respectively). In this real-world analysis, 25.2% of patients experienced R/R-DLBCL after 1L with poor outcomes. Given the findings of this study, there is a high unmet need for novel, safe, and effective treatment options for patients with R/R DLBCL.'",b'No',No
